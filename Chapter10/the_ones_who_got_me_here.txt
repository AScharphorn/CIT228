The ones that I drank all those beers with
Made it through those high school years with
All those girls I loved who broke my heart
All those back roads I drove 'round on
That church pew that I got found on
That college town where I first got my start
All the haters, all the lovers
All the friends that are more like brothers
All the people I ain't seen in too many years
All the faces in the bleachers
Never gave up on me teachers
Yeah this one's for the ones who got me here
The ones that said I'd never make it
The ones that said there's your chance, go take it
Took all of you for me to get this far
Jobs along the way that paid me
People who dug deep to raise me
Made me who I am, you know who you are
All the haters, all the lovers
All the friends that are more like brothers
All the people I ain't seen in too many years
All the faces in the bleachers
Never gave up on me preachers
Yeah this one's for the ones who got me here
The ones still around, the ones that are gone
My biggest fan, Mama back home
All the truth and all the dares
All the long shot late-night prayers
All the haters, all the lovers
My dad and my two brothers
All the people I ain't seen in too many years
And I thank God that I met ya
Hope you know I won't forget ya
This one's for the ones who got me here
Yeah this one's for the ones who got me here, yeah
