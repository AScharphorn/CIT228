Yeah, this world will turn its back
When you find yours against that wall
Just watch it as it keeps on spinning
Just like there's nothing wrong.
That's why I'm thumbing through these pages
They say the answers are in red
And I believe they're in there somewhere
I just haven't found 'em yet
It's the only hope that I got left
'Cause I could stand to lose my faith in
Friends that come and go
Yeah, they'll be there when you need them,
They say that when you don't
I could give up on my heroes
Could let myself down, too
But what would I do
If I lost my faith in you?
My faith in you!
You know I've learned through all these stories
All about the pain you felt
And I know you did all that for me
And I'm still asking you for help
'Cause Lord I just can't help myself!
I could stand to lose my faith in
Friends that come and go
Yeah, they'll be there when you need them,
They say that when you don't
I could give up on my heroes
Could let myself down, too
But what would I do
If I lost my faith in you?
My faith in you
'Cause I've been beaten, I've been broken
I've been dangerously bruised
And Lord, I never would have made it
If I'd of lost my faith in you
If I'd lost my faith in you
Know you always got my back
And I don't know why
It feels like I deserve it
For a hell raiser like me
To have a safe place to land
Can't thank you enough,
You saved my life
I will never lose my faith in you, oh, oh
My faith in you
I'll never lose my faith in you
