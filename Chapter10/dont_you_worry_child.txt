There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now they're memories are on the wall
I hear the sounds from the places where I was born
Up on a hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
"Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now"
Yeah!
Ohh, oh
"Don't you worry, don't you worry now"
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world
I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend, hmm
Up on a hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
"Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now"
Yeah!
Ohh, oh
"See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now"
"Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now"
